# PSOZ-ResourcePack:

Official PSOZ ResourcePack. <br />
This is a custom mixpack with various resourcepacks and individual textures thrown together. <br />
These were collected over the years of playing and arranged by me for a better gaming experience. <br />
For more details you can read the Changelog or may contact me.

# Legal Note:

I am not the creator of all the textures used here nor do i have copyright(s) for most of them. <br />
Im only the compilator of this mixpack. <br />

If you are the owner of one of the used textures and want to be credited for it:
  - Just let me know and i'll add you to the list.

If you own one of the used textures and dont want them in here:
  - Please contact me with a request for removal.

# Known Bugs:

  - Transparent/Black world (no rendered blocks): Just hop into another World/Server or reload textures with F3+T to fix this.
